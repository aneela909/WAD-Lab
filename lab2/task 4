  <h1>Seasons</h1>

  <h2>Spring</h2><hr>
  <p>
    Spring is the season of renewal and growth. Flowers bloom, trees regain their leaves, 
    and the world becomes full of color again after the cold winter months. 
    The air is fresh and filled with the fragrance of blossoms, and the days gradually 
    become warmer and longer.<br>
    Many cultures celebrate spring with festivals and traditions that highlight fertility, 
    hope, and new beginnings. It is also a time when animals come out of hibernation 
    and birds migrate back, filling the skies with life and sound.

  <h2>Summer</h2><hr>
  <p>
    Summer is known for its hot days, bright sunshine, and long daylight hours. 
    People often enjoy vacations, beach trips, and outdoor activities during this season. 
    Fruits like mangoes, watermelon, and berries are abundant, making it a time of 
    refreshing flavors.<br>
    It is also a season of relaxation and joy, where families gather for picnics, 
    children enjoy their school holidays, and festivals and cultural events bring 
    people together in celebration.
